                        </h5>
                        The benefit of tours to Petra over traveling independently lies both in cost-effectiveness, and convenience. The cost of the entry fee to Petra is significant. For example, on a one day trip from Israel, it stands at $130 per person, and therefore, when considering the cost of a tour at $199, the tour is very accessible, as it includes all transport, guiding, and some food.  On the convenience front, tours to Petra include arranging the visa to Jordan, assistance at the border and all the other coordination needed to ensure that the trip runs perfectly. Travel by taxi is possible, however, is more expensive. Groups or those with special requirements offer organise a private tour to Petra.
